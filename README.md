# emotion-analyzer
EAS uses a microphone and camera to analyze the user's voice and facial expressions and then processes the results through a neural network to determine the user's emotions accurately.
# üéôÔ∏è Emotion Analyzer - Speech Emotion Recognition using Wav2Vec2 + Keras

This repository provides a speech emotion recognition system that classifies emotions from Telugu audio clips using Wav2Vec2 XLS-R for feature extraction and a custom Keras classifier. The model is trained to detect emotions such as **Positive**, **Negitive**, and **Neutral**.

## üöÄ Features

- Utilizes [Facebook's Wav2Vec2 XLS-R](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) for powerful multilingual speech representations.
- Designed for **Telugu** audio emotion classification.
- Fast and lightweight classifier using Keras dense layers.
- Easily extendable to other Indian languages with minimal changes.

## üß† Model Architecture

1. **Wav2Vec2 XLS-R** (pretrained): Extracts robust audio features.
2. **Keras Dense Classifier**: Custom neural network to classify emotion states.
